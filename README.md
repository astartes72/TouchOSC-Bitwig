Mappings and Script for Touch OSC and Bitwig

This is a Work in Progress ;-)

Mappings based on the TouchOSC-Script from Thomas Helzle.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Basic TouchOSC Layout by Astartes, improved and extended by Thomas Helzle ;-)
=======
Mappings in Touch OSC: 
Page 1: 
Buttons for Restart, Stop, Play, Record, Overdub
Volume Faders
Pan
Mastervolume

Page 2: 
Device Macros (taken from Thomas´ Android- Phone Mapping included in this Repo mostly as a help for me to have all mappings in one Place) 

Page 3:
Mappings for Primary Device (again taken from Thomas´ Android Mapping)

Page 4: 
4 X/Y Pads for use with the X/Y Devices or mappable to whatever Controller you like. Original Page done by me, modified by Thomas.

Page 5:
Setup, actually only used for the mapping of the X/Y Pads

These Pages are exactly the same in the iPad (or Tablet) and the Phone Layout

The 960x540 (Phone) Layout also includes a Drumpad Page and a one Octave Keyboard Page, Both with Transpose Up/Down Functionality

The iPad Mapping includes a 8x8 Button Matrix, all Buttons set to Toggle-Mode and 2 Multy X/Y Pads one Mapped to Device Macros and one Mapped to the Primary Devie

Also included in this Repo is an alternative Mapping i´m actually working on (This is the Mapping that all has started with). This one is far from finished and for now included to have it all in one Place.
